    "why": "Botched exits destroy team trust — remaining employees watch how departures are handled to judge if they're safe; poorly managed exits also create legal risk and damage employer brand. At Netflix, the Keeper Test normalizes honest performance conversations so exits are rarely a surprise — when someone leaves, the team understands why because the culture of candor precedes it.",
    "how": "Decide with conviction after fair process; deliver the message directly and clearly; provide timeline and support; communicate to team without violating privacy; ensure knowledge transfer; offer genuine career support; debrief with HR on process quality",
    "expectedResult": "Departing employee feels treated fairly even if disappointed; remaining team trusts the process; zero legal escalations; knowledge transfer complete; team morale preserved",
