    "title": "Your VP Wants Engineering to 'Own Security' But Nobody Has Expertise",
    "description": "Your VP has decided that security should shift left into engineering. There's no dedicated security team, no AppSec engineer, and nobody on your team has deep security expertise. A recent incident — a feature shipped with a known SQL injection vulnerability because 'security didn't review it in time' — has made this an urgent priority. You're expected to embed security into the development lifecycle, but your engineers see security as 'not my job' and compliance requirements are growing.",

    "title": "Driving Culture Change Against Organizational Resistance",
    "description": "You've been hired or promoted to improve engineering culture, but the broader organization actively resists change. Legacy norms, hostile leadership, or institutional inertia work against your efforts. Your skip-level doesn't see culture as a priority, peers are indifferent or defensive, and your team is cynical from failed past initiatives. You believe the culture needs to change, but you lack the organizational power to mandate it.",

Each team's version is slightly different, creating maintenance burden and inconsistent user experience. You've identified the opportunity to extract a platform team, but you need to restructure without disrupting current delivery.",

You could build it in-house or buy/adopt an external solution. The build option gives you full control but costs engineering time. The buy option is faster but creates vendor dependency. Both camps have passionate advocates on the team. You need a structured decision process.",

Meetings that worked in-person don't translate — some people are in a conference room while others are on small laptop screens. Information flows through hallway conversations that remote team members miss. Async communication is chaotic, and remote engineers feel like second-class citizens.

Key results are either unmeasurable ('improve developer experience'), sandbagged ('deploy at least once per sprint' when you already deploy daily), or activity-based ('ship features X, Y, Z') rather than outcome-based.
