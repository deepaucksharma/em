Added two new anti-patterns to restore the floor: The Shadow Bypass (engineers circumventing security controls due to friction) and The Certification Facade (maintaining certifications without following certified practices day-to-day). All 14 capabilities now confirmed at 5+ anti-patterns."

Calibration signals capture novel concepts: neurodiversity accommodation, application identity as culture, inclusive facilitation techniques, internal mobility as health signal, hackathons for belonging, and conversation smell detection."
